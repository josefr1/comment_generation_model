#### The following script uses the meta llama-3.2-3B-Instruct text generation model to create a message based on a topic and optional previous message. The previous message allows the model to create a more personalized message(i.e. responding to a message) however it can also create a new message just based off the topic.

#### Below are key details about the functions currently used, including their compute time and recommendations for applications.

"""### Pipeline Details
#### **Models Used:**
* text generation: meta-lama/llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
* image-to-text generation: Salesforce blip-image-captioning-base

#### **Functions**


---


**1. create_prompt() --> Prompt for the comment generation model**

Input Params
* string: game_title
* list: username_list
* string: game_description
* string: image_description
* string(optional): previous_comment

Output
* string: base_prompt

---
**2. is_valid_message() --> Checks if output of comment is correct**

Input Params
* string: message

Output
* boolean: True/False
---
**3. generate_message() --> Runs text generation model and returns the comment**

Input Params
* string: game_title
* list: username_list
* string(optional): previous_comment

Output
* string: comment



---
**4. image_to_text() --> Runs image generation model and returns the description of the image**

Input Params
* string: image(png/jpg work)

Output
* string: comment


---
**5. Time Cost:**
* CPU: ~300s
* GPU - T4: ~1.1s
---
**6. Recommendations:**

Feed model data
* For each game page created(where users play each individual game), track usernames(if usernames aren't tracked for each individual game, taking a name from active users list is fine as well) and previous comment(this may or may not need to be created)

Use model on chat feature
* create api using model and call api after every comments(only takes 1s or write a script that creates many comments)

Update and Repeat
* update the previous_comment param fed into function #1 and call api again

You are generating a single **comment** from a random user on a comment section (like YouTube or TikTok) for the game **{game_title}**.
Choose the username **ONLY** from this list: {username_list}.

The game description is:
\"\"\"{game_description}\"\"\"

The current image shows:
\"\"\"{image_description}\"\"\"

Comments may talk about the game, the image, or both.

**Comment Style Guidelines (choose one style at random):**
- Share excitement, enthusiasm, or positive reactions about the game or the image.
- Compliment the game's visuals, mechanics, soundtrack, or style.
- Ask a friendly question or express curiosity.
- Share a personal experience or fun memory related to the game.
- Lightly critique or offer suggestions, but keep the tone respectful, balanced, or constructive (e.g., “I wish there were more levels like this!” or “It’s fun, though the controls can feel a bit tricky sometimes.”).
- Use playful or humorous comments that feel natural in a social media comment section.

**Avoid full negativity, harsh criticism, or toxic comments. Critique is allowed only if it feels fair, balanced, or framed politely.**

{previous_section}

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Output MUST be in the exact format:
  Username: Comment
- Do NOT include quotes, brackets, bullet points, or any extra formatting.
- Do NOT include explanations, prefaces, or any additional text.
- Write the comment naturally, like a real person posting in a comment section.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT (format only, content will change):**
mushroomDash: Love the energy of this level, the power-ups make it feel so satisfying!

Now, generate exactly ONE comment.
Output ONLY the comment in the format: Username: Comment
